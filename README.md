# Suteppu

Step by step copy paste for presenting code with [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship) style.

I made this extension as a fun project and was intended to use it as a way to teach without ever having to type any code.. and yea I know, I know... you can do all of this by just removing and stepping back using the built-in undo system from vscode. But with this extension, you can save your steps into a file for use later on in the future.

Welp.. it's still kinda a useless extension tbh.
